Comprehensive AI Diagnostic Analysis

1. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS

Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the 
intermittent crank/no-start condition is a fault in the vehicle's *wiring 
harness or a connector related to the CAN (Controller Area Network) 
communication system*. The intermittent nature of the problem, combined 
with the previous repairs (fuel pump, fuel pump drive module, cluster) and 
the presence of U-codes (U1900, U2023) and a B-code (B1884) suggests this. 
I have 70% confidence in this diagnosis.

*   **Reference Error Codes:** The codes U1900 (CAN Communication Bus Fault 
- Communication Bus Fault), U2023 (Communication Bus Fault - PCM Received 
Invalid Data) and B1884 (Airbag Lamp Circuit Failure) indicate a 
communication problem within the vehicle's electrical system. These codes, 
in the context of a crank/no-start condition, strongly suggest a problem 
disrupting data flow between essential modules like the PCM (Powertrain 
Control Module), instrument cluster, and potentially others.

*   **Component Failure Analysis:** The CAN network is essential for 
communication between various modules in the vehicle. A faulty connection, 
damaged wiring, or a malfunctioning module on the CAN bus can cause 
intermittent communication failures, leading to a crank/no-start condition. 
The previously replaced cluster could be related if the original cluster 
was a source of the CAN issue, but it does not seem to have fully resolved 
the intermittent operation issue.

*   **Age/Mileage Considerations:** At 265,425 miles, the vehicle's wiring 
harness is likely experiencing wear and tear. Connectors can become 
corroded, wires can chafe and break, and insulation can degrade, leading to 
intermittent electrical issues. The age and mileage significantly increase 
the likelihood of wiring harness or connector problems.

**Data Needed:**

*   **Full DTC Scan with Ford IDS (Integrated Diagnostic System):** A 
complete scan using Ford's factory diagnostic tool is crucial to identify 
all active and stored DTCs in *all* modules, not just generic OBD-II codes. 
This will provide a more comprehensive picture of the communication issues.

*   **CAN Bus Voltage Measurement:** Measure the CAN bus voltage at various 
points in the network (DLC/OBD-II connector, PCM, cluster) while the fault 

DiagnosticPro — Proprietary AI Diagnostic Report

is present. Look for out-of-range voltages or signal dropouts. Ford IDS is 
required.

*   **Detailed Wiring Harness Inspection:** Conduct a thorough visual 
inspection of the wiring harness, focusing on areas prone to damage (e.g., 
near the engine, exhaust, suspension, and areas where the harness passes 
through the body). Pay close attention to connectors, looking for 
corrosion, loose pins, and damaged wiring.

2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Here are other potential causes of the crank/no-start condition, ranked 
by likelihood:
**Faulty Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor (20% likelihood):** A failing 
CKP sensor can intermittently prevent the PCM from recognizing engine 
rotation, leading to a no-start condition. *Ruled in:* CKP sensor failure 
is a common cause of crank/no-start issues. *Ruled out:* No specific CKP 
sensor codes were mentioned, but intermittent CKP failure is possible 
even without a code. Requires testing with an oscilloscope to verify 
proper signal during cranking. Ford TSB 04-26-11 details intermittent CKP 
signal loss.
**Faulty Ignition Switch (5% likelihood):** An intermittent ignition 
switch can prevent power from reaching essential circuits, including the 
starter and PCM. *Ruled in:* An ignition switch failure can cause a no-
start condition. *Ruled out:* No specific ignition switch codes were 
mentioned, and ignition switch problems are less common than wiring 
issues at this mileage.
**PCM Failure (5% likelihood):** Though less common, a failing PCM can 
cause intermittent no-start conditions. *Ruled in:* PCM failure can 
disrupt essential engine control functions. *Ruled out:* PCM failure is 
relatively rare without other associated symptoms or codes, and CAN 
issues are more probable in this case. Requires advanced diagnostics, 
often including PCM reflashing or replacement.
Equipment-Specific Failure Patterns:**
Older Ford F-150s are known for wiring harness issues, particularly in 
areas exposed to heat, vibration, and moisture. The area around the fuel 
tank and rear chassis for the fuel pump wiring is a known trouble area.
Connector corrosion is a common problem, especially in areas exposed to 
road salt and moisture. The fuel pump connector is a prime suspect, even 
if the pump itself was recently replaced.
The instrument cluster on these vehicles can sometimes cause CAN bus 
issues, particularly if it's failing internally. The cluster was replaced 
but not the connector that plugs into it.

3. DIAGNOSTIC VERIFICATION

To verify the diagnosis, the shop MUST perform these tests:

DiagnosticPro — Proprietary AI Diagnostic Report

*   **Ford IDS Full System Scan and DTC Retrieval:** Connect a Ford IDS 
(Integrated Diagnostic System) scan tool to the vehicle and perform a full 
system scan. Document ALL DTCs present in ALL modules, not just generic P-
codes. This is crucial for identifying the root cause of the communication 
issues. *Tools Needed:* Ford IDS scan tool. *Expected Readings:* A 
comprehensive list of DTCs, including U-codes (network communication), B-
codes (body), and P-codes (powertrain). *Cost Estimate:* $150 - $250 
(depending on shop rates).

*   **CAN Bus Voltage and Resistance Testing:** Use an oscilloscope to 
measure the CAN bus voltage at the DLC (OBD-II connector) and at key 
modules like the PCM and instrument cluster. Also, measure the CAN bus 
resistance with the key off. *Tools Needed:* Oscilloscope, digital 
multimeter. *Expected Readings:* CAN high voltage should be around 
2.5-3.5V, CAN low voltage should be around 1.5-2.5V with the engine 
running. CAN bus resistance should be approximately 60 ohms with the key 
off and the battery disconnected. Deviations from these readings indicate a 
problem. *Cost Estimate:* $200 - $300 (depending on shop rates).

*   **Wiring Harness Visual Inspection and Connector Testing:** Thoroughly 
inspect the wiring harness, focusing on areas near the engine, exhaust, and 
chassis. Check for chafing, corrosion, and damaged wiring. Carefully 
inspect connectors, looking for loose pins, corrosion, and broken wires. 
Perform pin drag tests on suspect connectors to check for loose 
connections. *Tools Needed:* Inspection light, multimeter, connector test 
kit. *Expected Readings:* Clean, tight connectors with no signs of 
corrosion or damage. Continuity between connector pins and module 
terminals. *Cost Estimate:* $200 - $400 (depending on time spent).

*   **CKP Sensor Testing (if wiring harness and CAN bus testing is 
inconclusive):** Use an oscilloscope to verify the CKP sensor's output 
signal during cranking. *Tools Needed:* Oscilloscope. *Expected Readings:* 
A clean, consistent waveform with the correct frequency and amplitude. 
*Cost Estimate:* $100-$200

4. SHOP INTERROGATION

Here are five technical questions to ask the shop, designed to expose 
incompetence:

5. CONVERSATION SCRIPTING

*   **Opening:** "Hi, I'm following up on the F-150 I brought in last week. 
I've done some research and want to understand the diagnostic process you 
used."

*   **Phrasing:** Frame questions as curiosity: "I'm curious about how you 
approached diagnosing the CAN bus system. What specific tests did you 
perform?"

DiagnosticPro — Proprietary AI Diagnostic Report

*   **Example Dialogue:**

    *   **You:** "Can you show me the Ford IDS diagnostic report, including 
*all* DTCs from *all* modules?"

    *   **Shop:** "We only checked for generic codes."

    *   **You:** "I understand, but I've read that Ford-specific codes can 
provide valuable information. Would it be possible to run a full system 
scan with the Ford IDS tool?"

    *   **You:** "What were the CAN bus voltage readings at the DLC and PCM 
during cranking?"

    *   **Shop:** "We didn't check the CAN bus."

    *   **You:** "I see. I was under the impression that CAN bus testing 
was a standard procedure for communication issues. Could you explain why 
that wasn't performed?"

*   **Body Language:** Maintain a calm, respectful demeanor. Make eye 
contact and listen attentively to their responses. Avoid accusatory 
language or gestures.

*   **Response Handling:** If they get defensive, acknowledge their 
expertise but reiterate your desire to understand the diagnostic process. 
"I appreciate your experience, and I'm not questioning your abilities. I'm 
simply trying to gain a better understanding of what's going on with my 
vehicle."

*   **Exit Strategy:** If you're not satisfied with their answers, politely 
decline further service. "Thank you for your time. I'd like to consider my 
options before proceeding. I appreciate you explaining what you've done so 
far."

*   **NEVER say:** "My AI report says..." or "I got a second opinion 
online."

*   **ALWAYS say:** "I've done some research and want to understand..."

6. COST BREAKDOWN

**Fair Parts Pricing Analysis:** It is difficult to give any parts 
pricing, as there is no single part currently indicated in the repair. 
The cost to repair the wiring harness (pins, tape, electrical cleaner, 
etc) is relatively inexpensive.
**Labor Hour Estimates:** The initial diagnostic work including Ford IDS 
scan and wiring harness inspection, CAN bus testing can require 4-6 
hours. The repair itself is highly dependent on the location of the 
damage in the harness, and its complexity.
**Total Price Range:** $400 - $1000 for diagnostics; repair costs are 
highly variable depending on the fault location and severity.

DiagnosticPro — Proprietary AI Diagnostic Report

**Overcharge Identification Markers:** Be wary of inflated labor rates or 
unnecessary parts replacements. Ask for a detailed breakdown of all 
charges and compare prices with other shops.

7. RIPOFF DETECTION

**Parts Cannon Indicators:** Replacing multiple parts without proper 
diagnostics (e.g., fuel pump, fuel pump drive module, cluster) can 
indicate a "parts cannon" approach. Be wary if the shop suggests 
replacing the PCM without thoroughly testing the wiring harness and CAN 
bus.
**Diagnostic Shortcuts to Watch For:** Skipping crucial diagnostic steps, 
such as Ford IDS scan, CAN bus testing, and wiring harness inspection, 
can lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary repairs.
**Price Gouging Red Flags:** Inflated labor rates, excessive markups on 
parts, and charging for unnecessary services are all red flags. Always 
get a written estimate and compare prices with other shops.

8. AUTHORIZATION GUIDE

*   **What to Approve Immediately:** Approve the initial diagnostic work 
including the Ford IDS scan, CAN bus testing, and wiring harness 
inspection. This is essential for identifying the root cause of the 
problem.

*   **What to Reject Outright:** Reject any suggestions to replace major 
components (e.g., PCM, CKP sensor, ignition switch) without proper 
diagnostic testing.

*   **When to Get a Second Opinion:** If you're not confident in the shop's 
diagnosis or if they suggest expensive repairs without providing clear 
justification, get a second opinion from a reputable Ford specialist.

9. TECHNICAL EDUCATION

**System Operation Explanation:** The CAN bus is a communication network 
that allows various modules in the vehicle (e.g., PCM, instrument 
cluster, ABS module) to share information. This information is crucial 
for proper engine operation, vehicle control, and diagnostics.
**Failure Mechanism Details:** Wiring harness issues can be caused by 
chafing, corrosion, vibration, and heat. Connectors can become corroded, 
loose, or damaged, leading to intermittent electrical problems. A faulty 
CAN bus can disrupt communication between modules, causing a variety of 
symptoms, including a crank/no-start condition.
**Prevention Tips for Future:** Regularly inspect the wiring harness for 
signs of damage. Clean connectors and apply dielectric grease to prevent 
corrosion. Avoid exposing the wiring harness to excessive heat or 
moisture.

10. OEM PARTS STRATEGY

Because there is no specific part needed at the moment, I cannot give an 
exact part number. However, generally for wiring harness repairs, use OEM 
connectors and wiring if possible to ensure proper fit and reliability.
**Why OEM is Critical for This Repair:** Aftermarket wiring harness 
components may not meet OEM specifications, leading to future problems.
**Pricing Sources and Alternatives:** Ford parts can be purchased from 
dealerships, online retailers (e.g., Ford Parts Giant, Tasca Parts), and 
reputable aftermarket suppliers.

11. NEGOTIATION TACTICS

**Price Comparison Strategies:** Get quotes from multiple shops and 
compare prices for parts and labor.
**Labor Justification Questions:** Ask the shop to explain their labor 
rates and justify the amount of time required for each repair.
**Walk-Away Points and Leverage:** Be prepared to walk away if the shop 
is unwilling to negotiate or if you're not confident in their diagnosis.

12. LIKELY CAUSES (RANKED)

**Primary Cause:** Wiring harness/connector issue related to the CAN bus 
(70% confidence). The U-codes, intermittent nature of the problem, and 
high mileage all point to this.
**Secondary Cause:** Faulty Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor (20% 
confidence). Though no specific CKP codes, it's a common cause of no-
start conditions and requires verification.
**Tertiary Cause:** Faulty Ignition Switch (5% confidence). The switch 
could intermittently prevent power from reaching essential circuits.

13. RECOMMENDATIONS

**Immediate Actions Required:** Take the vehicle to a qualified Ford 
technician for a Ford IDS scan and comprehensive wiring harness 
inspection.
**Future Maintenance Schedule:** Regularly inspect the wiring harness for 
signs of damage. Clean connectors and apply dielectric grease to prevent 
corrosion.
**Warning Signs to Monitor:** Any recurrence of the crank/no-start 
condition, along with other electrical issues (e.g., flickering lights, 
instrument cluster problems), should be addressed promptly.
