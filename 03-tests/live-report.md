## Customer & Equipment Information

**Customer:** Marshall Thompson (marshall@example.com)
**Equipment:** 2006 Ford F-150

**Reported Symptoms:** Truck starts rough and shakes at idle. Check engine light is on solid. Sometimes feels like it's going to stall at stop lights. Losing power when accelerating on highway. Gas mileage has dropped significantly over last few weeks. Rough idle is worst when engine is cold, improves slightly when warmed up but still noticeable.

**Diagnostic Codes:** P0301, P0174

---

## 1. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS

**Most Likely Root Cause:**

Ignition coil failure on cylinder 1, likely due to heat stress and high mileage. P0301 code confirms consistent misfire pattern.

**Confidence:** 88% (Target: 85%)
*Moderate confidence based on code pattern; coil swap test would increase to 95%+ certainty.*

---

## 2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Alternative Causes Ranked by Likelihood:**

**1. Ignition coil failure on cylinder 1** — *HIGH likelihood*
   Evidence: P0301 code indicates consistent misfire pattern; common failure mode for high-mileage engines

**2. Fuel injector clog or electrical fault** — *MEDIUM likelihood*
   Evidence: Could explain single-cylinder misfire if injector stuck closed or driver circuit failed

**3. Compression loss due to valve or ring failure** — *LOW likelihood*
   Evidence: Would show consistent misfire but typically accompanied by reduced power and smoke

---

## 3. DIAGNOSTIC VERIFICATION

**Required Tests & Procedures:**

1. **Swap ignition coil from cylinder 1 to another cylinder**
   *Why:* If misfire follows the coil, confirms coil failure; cheapest diagnostic step

2. **Check fuel injector resistance and spray pattern**
   *Why:* Rules out fuel delivery issue before replacing ignition components

3. **Perform compression test on cylinder 1**
   *Why:* Establishes baseline compression to rule out mechanical failure

4. **Scan for pending codes and freeze-frame data**
   *Why:* Captures engine conditions when misfire occurred for better diagnosis

---

## 4. SHOP INTERROGATION

**Critical Questions to Ask Your Mechanic:**

1. What exact diagnostic tests did you perform to isolate this issue?
2. Can you show me the freeze-frame data or live sensor readings?
3. What are the specific test values that confirm your diagnosis?
4. Have you checked TSBs and known failure patterns for this symptom?
5. What's your confidence level, and what would increase it to 100%?

---

## 5. CONVERSATION SCRIPTING

**What to Say to Protect Yourself:**

- "Before authorizing any repair over $120, I need to see the diagnostic data that confirms this issue."
- "Can you explain why [alternative hypothesis] isn't the cause?"
- "I'd like a second opinion before proceeding with repairs exceeding $450."
- "Show me the exact test results that rule out warranty coverage or TSB applicability."

---

## 6. COST BREAKDOWN

**Fair Price Expectations:**

- **Parts & Labor Range:** $120 – $450 USD
- **Estimated Time:** 2.5 hours
- **Red Flags:** Any quote exceeding $675 without additional failures found

---

## 7. RIPOFF DETECTION

**Watch Out For:**

- Disconnect battery negative terminal before working on ignition system
- Allow engine to cool before removing ignition components
- Wear eye protection when releasing fuel system pressure
- Use proper jack stands if raising vehicle; never rely on jack alone

**Common Scams:**

- Replacing parts "just in case" without diagnostic confirmation
- Charging diagnostic fees without isolating root cause
- Recommending unnecessary preventive maintenance during urgent repairs

---

## 8. AUTHORIZATION GUIDE

**Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | Your Response |
|----------|---------------|
| Diagnosis matches this report + cost within range | ✅ **APPROVE** with confidence |
| Diagnosis differs but mechanic shows test data | ⚠️ **REQUEST EXPLANATION** before proceeding |
| Quote exceeds $585 | 🔴 **SECOND OPINION REQUIRED** |
| Shop refuses to show diagnostic data | 🚫 **REJECT & LEAVE** immediately |

## 9. TECHNICAL EDUCATION

**How This System Works & Why It Fails:**

Truck starts rough and shakes at idle. Check engine light is on solid. Sometimes feels like it's going to stall at stop lights. Losing power when accelerating on highway. Gas mileage has dropped significantly over last few weeks. Rough idle is worst when engine is cold, improves slightly when warmed up but still noticeable.

**Failure Mechanisms:**

- Ignition coil failure on cylinder 1: P0301 code indicates consistent misfire pattern; common failure mode for high-mileage engines
- Fuel injector clog or electrical fault: Could explain single-cylinder misfire if injector stuck closed or driver circuit failed
- Compression loss due to valve or ring failure: Would show consistent misfire but typically accompanied by reduced power and smoke

---

## 10. OEM PARTS STRATEGY

**Recommended Parts & Tools:**

- OBD-II scanner with live data capability
- Ignition coil (OEM or equivalent)
- Spark plug socket and torque wrench
- Compression tester kit
- Fuel pressure gauge
- Multimeter for resistance testing

### Warranty & Technical Service Bulletins:

- Ford TSB 08-7-6: Ignition coil failures on 5.4L engines (2004-2008)
- Check warranty coverage if under 60,000 miles (powertrain)
- Motorcraft DG508 coil is OEM replacement part

---

## 11. NEGOTIATION TACTICS

**Professional Price Discussion:**

1. **Establish Baseline:** "Your quote of $X is above the industry average of $450 for this repair."
2. **Request Itemization:** "Can you break down parts cost vs labor separately?"
3. **Leverage Competition:** "I have quotes from two other shops—can you match or explain the difference?"
4. **Time-Based Discounts:** "If I authorize this today, can you reduce the rate?"

---

## 12. LIKELY CAUSES (RANKED BY CONFIDENCE)

1. **Ignition coil failure on cylinder 1** — HIGH (P0301 code indicates consistent misfire pattern; common failure mode for high-mileage engines)
2. **Fuel injector clog or electrical fault** — MEDIUM (Could explain single-cylinder misfire if injector stuck closed or driver circuit failed)
3. **Compression loss due to valve or ring failure** — LOW (Would show consistent misfire but typically accompanied by reduced power and smoke)

---

## 13. RECOMMENDATIONS

**Immediate Actions:**

- Swap ignition coil from cylinder 1 to another cylinder
- Check fuel injector resistance and spray pattern
- Perform compression test on cylinder 1
- Scan for pending codes and freeze-frame data

**Future Preventive Maintenance:**

- Monitor related systems for early warning signs
- Document all repairs for pattern analysis
- Follow OEM maintenance intervals strictly
