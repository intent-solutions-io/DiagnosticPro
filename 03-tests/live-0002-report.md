## Customer & Equipment Information

**Customer:** Sarah Mitchell (sarah.mitchell@example.com)
**Equipment:** 2019 Carrier Infinity 18

**Reported Symptoms:** Central AC not cooling properly; runs continuously but house temperature won't drop below 78°F when set to 72°F; condenser running but quieter than usual; no ice; serviced 6 months ago; energy bills increased.

**Diagnostic Codes:** E1

---

## 1. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS

**Most Likely Root Cause:**

The most likely cause is a refrigerant leak leading to low refrigerant levels and inefficient cooling.

**Confidence:** 85% (Target: 85%)
*Confidence is adequate that a refrigerant leak is the primary cause of the issue.*

---

## 2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Alternative Causes Ranked by Likelihood:**

**1. Refrigerant leak** — *HIGH likelihood*
   Evidence: Refrigerant 'a bit low' 6 months ago; increased energy bills suggest reduced efficiency.

**2. Failing compressor** — *MEDIUM likelihood*
   Evidence: Condenser running quieter than usual; inefficient cooling.

**3. Restricted airflow** — *LOW likelihood*
   Evidence: Inefficient cooling despite continuous operation.

---

## 3. DIAGNOSTIC VERIFICATION

**Required Tests & Procedures:**

1. **Inspect refrigerant lines and components for leaks using electronic leak detector and bubble solution.**
   *Why:* To identify and locate the source of refrigerant leak.

2. **Repair any identified leaks by sealing or replacing damaged components.**
   *Why:* To prevent further refrigerant loss and restore system efficiency.

3. **Evacuate the system and recharge with the correct type and amount of refrigerant per manufacturer's specifications.**
   *Why:* To ensure optimal system performance and prevent overcharging or undercharging.

4. **Monitor system pressures and temperatures after recharge to verify proper operation.**
   *Why:* To confirm the system is cooling efficiently and identify any remaining issues.

5. **If no leaks are found, test compressor performance and efficiency.**
   *Why:* To rule out a failing compressor.

6. **Inspect blower motor and coil for restrictions.**
   *Why:* To ensure adequate airflow.

## 4. SHOP INTERROGATION

**Critical Questions to Ask Your Mechanic:**

1. What exact diagnostic tests did you perform to isolate this issue?
2. Can you show me the freeze-frame data or live sensor readings?
3. What are the specific test values that confirm your diagnosis?
4. Have you checked TSBs and known failure patterns for this symptom?
5. What's your confidence level, and what would increase it to 100%?

---

## 5. CONVERSATION SCRIPTING

**What to Say to Protect Yourself:**

- "Before authorizing any repair over $200, I need to see the diagnostic data that confirms this issue."
- "Can you explain why [alternative hypothesis] isn't the cause?"
- "I'd like a second opinion before proceeding with repairs exceeding $1200."
- "Show me the exact test results that rule out warranty coverage or TSB applicability."

---

## 6. COST BREAKDOWN

**Fair Price Expectations:**

- **Parts & Labor Range:** $200 – $1200 USD
- **Estimated Time:** 4 hours
- **Red Flags:** Any quote exceeding $1800 without additional failures found

---

## 7. RIPOFF DETECTION

**Watch Out For:**

- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and eye protection, when handling refrigerant.
- Refrigerant can cause frostbite. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.
- Ensure proper ventilation when working with refrigerant.
- Recover refrigerant properly according to EPA regulations.
- Disconnect power to the unit before beginning any repairs.

**Common Scams:**

- Replacing parts "just in case" without diagnostic confirmation
- Charging diagnostic fees without isolating root cause
- Recommending unnecessary preventive maintenance during urgent repairs

## 8. AUTHORIZATION GUIDE

**Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | Your Response |
|----------|---------------|
| Diagnosis matches this report + cost within range | ✅ **APPROVE** with confidence |
| Diagnosis differs but mechanic shows test data | ⚠️ **REQUEST EXPLANATION** before proceeding |
| Quote exceeds $1560 | 🔴 **SECOND OPINION REQUIRED** |
| Shop refuses to show diagnostic data | 🚫 **REJECT & LEAVE** immediately |

## 9. TECHNICAL EDUCATION

**How This System Works & Why It Fails:**

Central AC not cooling properly; runs continuously but house temperature won't drop below 78°F when set to 72°F; condenser running but quieter than usual; no ice; serviced 6 months ago; energy bills increased.

**Failure Mechanisms:**

- Refrigerant leak: Refrigerant 'a bit low' 6 months ago; increased energy bills suggest reduced efficiency.
- Failing compressor: Condenser running quieter than usual; inefficient cooling.
- Restricted airflow: Inefficient cooling despite continuous operation.

---

## 10. OEM PARTS STRATEGY

**Recommended Parts & Tools:**

- Refrigerant leak detector
- Bubble solution
- Refrigerant
- Vacuum pump
- Manifold gauge set
- Nitrogen
- Wrenches
- Replacement refrigerant line(s) or valve(s) (if needed)

### Warranty & Technical Service Bulletins:

- No active TSBs or warranty coverage identified for this symptom pattern

---

## 11. NEGOTIATION TACTICS

**Professional Price Discussion:**

1. **Establish Baseline:** "Your quote of $X is above the industry average of $1200 for this repair."
2. **Request Itemization:** "Can you break down parts cost vs labor separately?"
3. **Leverage Competition:** "I have quotes from two other shops—can you match or explain the difference?"
4. **Time-Based Discounts:** "If I authorize this today, can you reduce the rate?"

---

## 12. LIKELY CAUSES (RANKED BY CONFIDENCE)

1. **Refrigerant leak** — HIGH (Refrigerant 'a bit low' 6 months ago; increased energy bills suggest reduced efficiency.)
2. **Failing compressor** — MEDIUM (Condenser running quieter than usual; inefficient cooling.)
3. **Restricted airflow** — LOW (Inefficient cooling despite continuous operation.)

## 13. RECOMMENDATIONS

**Immediate Actions:**

- Inspect refrigerant lines and components for leaks using electronic leak detector and bubble solution.
- Repair any identified leaks by sealing or replacing damaged components.
- Evacuate the system and recharge with the correct type and amount of refrigerant per manufacturer's specifications.
- Monitor system pressures and temperatures after recharge to verify proper operation.
- If no leaks are found, test compressor performance and efficiency.
- Inspect blower motor and coil for restrictions.

**Future Preventive Maintenance:**
