      "hypothesis": "Refrigerant leak",

    {
      "step": "Repair any identified leaks by sealing or replacing damaged components.",
      "why": "To prevent further refrigerant loss and restore system efficiency."
    },
    {
      "step": "Evacuate the system and recharge with the correct type and amount of refrigerant per manufacturer's specifications.",
      "why": "To ensure optimal system performance and prevent overcharging or undercharging."

    {
      "step": "Monitor system pressures and temperatures after recharge to verify proper operation.",

      "step": "If no leaks are found, test compressor performance and efficiency.",
      "why": "To rule out a failing compressor."
