## 1. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS
**Most Likely Root Cause:**
{{most_likely_cause}}

**Confidence:** {{confidence.score_pct}}% (Target: {{confidence.threshold_pct}}%)
{{confidence.assessment}}

{{#if confidence_uplift_requirements}}
### To Raise Confidence:
{{#each confidence_uplift_requirements}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

## 2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
**Alternative Causes Ranked by Likelihood:**

{{#each root_cause_hypotheses}}
**{{add @index 1}}. {{hypothesis}}** — *{{likelihood}} likelihood*
   Evidence: {{evidence}}

## 3. DIAGNOSTIC VERIFICATION
**Required Tests & Procedures:**

## 4. SHOP INTERROGATION
**Critical Questions to Ask Your Mechanic:**

1. What exact diagnostic tests did you perform to isolate this issue?
2. Can you show me the freeze-frame data or live sensor readings?
3. What are the specific test values that confirm your diagnosis?
4. Have you checked TSBs and known failure patterns for this symptom?
5. What's your confidence level, and what would increase it to 100%?

---

## 5. CONVERSATION SCRIPTING
**What to Say to Protect Yourself:**

- "Before authorizing any repair over ${{estimated_cost_range_usd.low}}, I need to see the diagnostic data that confirms this issue."
- "Can you explain why [alternative hypothesis] isn't the cause?"
- "I'd like a second opinion before proceeding with repairs exceeding ${{estimated_cost_range_usd.high}}."
- "Show me the exact test results that rule out warranty coverage or TSB applicability."

---

## 6. COST BREAKDOWN
**Fair Price Expectations:**

- **Parts & Labor Range:** ${{estimated_cost_range_usd.low}} – ${{estimated_cost_range_usd.high}} USD
- **Estimated Time:** {{estimated_time_hours}} hours
- **Red Flags:** Any quote exceeding ${{multiply estimated_cost_range_usd.high 1.5}} without additional failures found

## 7. RIPOFF DETECTION
**Watch Out For:**

{{#each safety_notes}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

**Common Scams:**
- Replacing parts "just in case" without diagnostic confirmation
- Charging diagnostic fees without isolating root cause
- Recommending unnecessary preventive maintenance during urgent repairs

## 8. AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
**Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | Your Response |
|----------|---------------|
| Diagnosis matches this report + cost within range | ✅ **APPROVE** with confidence |
| Diagnosis differs but mechanic shows test data | ⚠️ **REQUEST EXPLANATION** before proceeding |
| Quote exceeds ${{multiply estimated_cost_range_usd.high 1.3}} | 🔴 **SECOND OPINION REQUIRED** |
| Shop refuses to show diagnostic data | 🚫 **REJECT & LEAVE** immediately |

{{/each}}
{{else}}
- No active TSBs or warranty coverage identified for this symptom pattern
{{/if}}

## 11. NEGOTIATION TACTICS
**Professional Price Discussion:**

1. **Establish Baseline:** "Your quote of $X is above the industry average of ${{estimated_cost_range_usd.high}} for this repair."
2. **Request Itemization:** "Can you break down parts cost vs labor separately?"
3. **Leverage Competition:** "I have quotes from two other shops—can you match or explain the difference?"
4. **Time-Based Discounts:** "If I authorize this today, can you reduce the rate?"
