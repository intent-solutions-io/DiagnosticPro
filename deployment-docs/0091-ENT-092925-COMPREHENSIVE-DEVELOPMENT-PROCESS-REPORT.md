- Webhook-based event processing
- Google Secret Manager for credential storage

### Initial Problem Statement
At the commencement of the debugging session, the payment system was reported as "completely broken" with customers unable to complete transactions. The initial assessment indicated multiple potential failure points:

1. Payment form submission failures
2. Stripe session creation issues
3. Webhook processing breakdowns
4. AI analysis triggering problems
5. PDF generation and delivery failures

This broad problem scope necessitated a systematic approach to isolate and address each component individually.

## Methodology: Systematic Debugging Framework

### TaskWarrior Implementation
The debugging process implemented a rigorous TaskWarrior-based tracking system to ensure comprehensive coverage and accountability. This approach provided several critical advantages:

**Task Granularity:** Each component was isolated into discrete, testable units
**Progress Tracking:** Real-time visibility into completion status and blockers
**Evidence Collection:** Mandatory annotation of actual results rather than assumptions
**Rollback Capability:** Clear checkpoints for reverting problematic changes

### Testing Protocol Structure
The systematic testing followed a hierarchical approach:

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification**
- API Gateway accessibility and routing
- Cloud Run service operational status
- Environment variable configuration
- Secret Manager credential validation

**Phase 2: Core Functionality Testing**
- Diagnostic submission endpoint validation
- Payment session creation verification
- Webhook endpoint accessibility testing
- Storage system connectivity checks

**Phase 3: Integration Validation**
- End-to-end transaction flow testing
- Cross-component communication verification
- Error handling and recovery testing
- Performance and reliability assessment

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
A critical aspect of the methodology involved mandatory evidence collection for all claims. Rather than accepting theoretical functionality, each component required:

- Actual API response capture
- Log verification with timestamps
- Configuration state validation
- Reproducible test commands

This approach proved essential in distinguishing between actual failures and configuration gaps.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Problem Discovery: API Gateway Route Gaps
The first major discovery emerged during fundamental endpoint testing. Initial attempts to create payment sessions revealed a critical infrastructure gap:

**Issue Identified:** Missing `/saveSubmission` endpoint in API Gateway configuration
**Impact Assessment:** Complete blockage of diagnostic form submission
**Root Cause:** API Gateway OpenAPI specification lacked essential route definitions

**Technical Investigation:**
```bash
# Test revealed missing route
curl -X POST https://diagpro-gw-3tbssksx-3tbssksx.uc.gateway.dev/saveSubmission
# Response: {"message":"The current request is not defined by this API.","code":404}

# Backend verification showed endpoint exists
grep -n "app\.post.*saveSubmission" backend/index.js
# Result: Line 89 - endpoint properly defined in backend
```

**Solution Implementation:**
The resolution required updating the API Gateway OpenAPI specification to include the missing route:

```yaml
/saveSubmission:
  post:
    operationId: saveSubmission
    consumes:
      - application/json
    produces:
      - application/json
    parameters:
      - in: body
        name: body
        required: true
        schema:
          type: object
```

**Deployment Process:**
1. Created new API Gateway configuration: save-submission-config-v1
2. Updated gateway routing: diagpro-gw-3tbssksx
3. Validated endpoint accessibility
4. Performed integration testing

### Data Structure Analysis: Payload Format Requirements
Secondary testing revealed a critical data structure mismatch between frontend expectations and backend requirements.

**Issue Identified:** Backend expects nested payload structure
**Frontend Assumption:** Direct data submission format
**Backend Reality:** Required `{payload: {data}}` wrapper structure

**Technical Discovery:**
```javascript
// Backend expectation (line 94 in index.js)
const { payload } = req.body;

// Frontend submission format (incorrect)
{
  "equipmentType": "vehicle",
  "model": "Honda Civic",
  "symptoms": "Engine noise"
}

// Required format (correct)
{
  "payload": {
    "equipmentType": "vehicle",
    "model": "Honda Civic",
    "symptoms": "Engine noise"
  }
}
```

**Testing Validation:**
```bash
# Incorrect format test
curl -X POST [...] -d '{"equipmentType": "vehicle", "model": "test"}'
# Response: {"error":"Failed to save submission","code":"INTERNAL_ERROR"}

# Correct format test
curl -X POST [...] -d '{"payload": {"equipmentType": "vehicle", "model": "test"}}'
# Response: {"submissionId":"diag_1759175519923_06381e19"}
```

This discovery highlighted the importance of comprehensive API documentation and contract testing between frontend and backend components.
